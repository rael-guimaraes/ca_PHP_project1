            <p>I am from a small city in Brazil called Morrinhos, which is located on the state of Goias.
                I have not travelled much inside the country but there are many places where i want to go as soon as i get 
                the opportunity. The country is beautiful, with natural views, wild life and also beautiful beachs.

    &nbsp &nbsp Nowadays i am living in Dublin, Ireland. It is a great place to live and study. I have learnt so much about 
    Irish culture, and that is very exiting. Now that im living in Europe is easier to travel around and it is great
    because i have the opportunity to experience new cultures and i can learn a lot about them. <br>
    If you like travelling like me you can check the capital of some Europeans countries which you 
    might want to visit by clicking on it on the top of this page.
